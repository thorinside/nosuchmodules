Dual Morg
---------

The idea was to make a stereo filter that could be loaded onto Patch.init(). I started with a Moog Ladder filter,
and added Korg 35 filters to it. Used Eurorack Blocks, and Faust to get it working quickly. Just keeping it this way.

With Eurorack Blocks installed:

```shell
$ erbb configure
$ erbb build
$ erbb install
```
